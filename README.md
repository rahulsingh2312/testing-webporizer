## Overview
test 1 for github app


The GitHub WebP Converter App is a powerful tool that automates the process of converting JPG images to WebP format in your GitHub repositories. This app offers a convenient way to optimize image files for web usage, ensuring faster loading times and improved performance.

## Features

### 1. Automated Conversion

The GitHub WebP Converter App continuously monitors your repository for any newly added or modified JPG images. When it detects a JPG image, it automatically converts it to the WebP format without any manual intervention. This ensures that all your images are in the optimal format for web usage.

### 2. Pull Request Generation

Every image conversion is performed through a Pull Request (PR). This means that the app will create a dedicated PR for each image conversion, allowing you to review and approve the changes before they are merged into your repository. This ensures that you maintain full control over the image conversion process.

### 3. Customizable Configuration

The app provides a user-friendly configuration file that allows you to customize its behavior according to your needs. You can specify which directories or files should be monitored, set quality and compression settings for WebP images, and define rules for excluding specific images from conversion.

### 4. Image Compression

The GitHub WebP Converter App uses state-of-the-art WebP compression algorithms to reduce the file size of your images without compromising quality. This results in faster page load times and improved overall user experience.

### 5. Transparency Support

WebP format supports both lossy and lossless compression, as well as transparency. The app retains transparency information when converting JPG images, making it a versatile choice for handling a wide range of image types.

## How It Compares to ImgBot

The GitHub WebP Converter App offers several advantages over ImgBot:

### 1. Focus on WebP Conversion

While ImgBot provides various image optimization features, the GitHub WebP Converter App is specifically designed for converting JPG images to WebP. This focused approach ensures that your images are in the best format for web usage.

### 2. Transparency Support

Unlike ImgBot, which primarily focuses on lossy compression formats, the GitHub WebP Converter App fully supports transparency, making it suitable for images with alpha channels or transparency needs.

### 3. Granular Control

The app offers granular control over the conversion process through its customizable configuration. You can define specific rules and settings to tailor the image conversion process to your project's requirements.

### 4. Pull Request Workflow

ImgBot often performs optimizations directly on the main branch, which may not align with your development workflow. The GitHub WebP Converter App uses a Pull Request-based approach, allowing you to review and approve changes before they are merged into your repository, ensuring better version control.

### 5. Active Development

Our app is actively maintained and updated to support the latest GitHub features and WebP standards, ensuring long-term compatibility and optimal image conversion.
